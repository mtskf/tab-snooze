# Snooooze: The Modern Tab Snoozer for Focus

focus on now. Snooze for later.
Declutter your browser and your mind with Snooooze, the privacy-focused tab manager designed for productivity pros.

## Why Snooooze?

Too many open tabs? Afraid to close them because you might forget? Snooooze lets you temporarily stash tabs away until you're actually ready to deal with them. They disappear now and magically reopen exactly when you need them.

## Key Features

*   **⏱️ Smart Scheduling**: One-click presets for "Later Today", "Tomorrow", "This Weekend", or pick any custom date.
*   **🔄 Auto Restoration**: Tabs reopen automatically at your scheduled time—even if your computer was sleeping or Chrome was closed.
*   **⚡️ Keyboard First**: Blazing fast shortcuts. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + .` to open, then single keys (e.g., `L` for Later, `T` for Tomorrow) to snooze. Zero friction.
*   **📥 Inbox Zero for Tabs**: View all pending tabs in a clean, organized list. Restore or delete them early if you change your mind.
*   **🎨 Personalized Themes**: Customize your experience with sleek Dark Mode, vibrant Vivid colors, or an urgency-focused Heatmap.
*   **🌍 Timezone Aware**: Works perfectly wherever you are. "8:00 AM" means *your* 8:00 AM.
*   **🔒 Privacy First**: All data is stored locally on your device. No cloud sync, no tracking, complete privacy.

## Shortcuts (Customizable)

*   `Cmd/Ctrl` + `.`: Open Snooooze Popup
*   `L`: Snooze for Later Today
*   `E`: Snooze for This Evening
*   `T`: Snooze for Tomorrow
*   `S`: Snooze for This Weekend
*   `N`: Snooze for Next Monday
*   `P`: Pick a Custom Date

> **Tip:** Hold `Shift` while pressing any shortcut to snooze your **entire window** at once!

## What's New in v0.2.6

*   **🛡️ Auto Backup**: Your snoozed tabs are now automatically backed up locally in your browser. If data ever gets corrupted, Snooooze recovers from the latest backup automatically — no cloud, no tracking.
